# Running the code

Run the code by typing ```python main.py```. You need numpy and scipy for executing the code. Output folders with experimental results are created. The folders are named in the following way: ```seriesX_SHORTNAME_DATETIME```. See below for details on the different experimental series.

You can plot the results by running ```python postproc.py <foldername>```. You need matplotlib for plotting.

# Convergence Study

This code can be used to perform convergence studies in a partitioned multi-physics multi-scale setup. As a benchmark scenario the 1D heat transport equations is solved. For details see [1]. The convergence studies performed by this code are identical to the ones described in [1]. However, for a lower runtime, the discretization slightly differs for [1].

## Experimental Series 1

Order degradation to first order if classical implicit coupling is used with higher order schemes a regular domain

## Experimental Series 3

Second order if Strang splitting coupling is used with higher order schemes on a non-regular domain
